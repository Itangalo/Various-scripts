This batch script takes any file you drop on it and creates a time-stamped version, saved in a sub folder. You are asked for a log message, which will be saved along with name and time in a log file.

The script is intended to use when you want to have some kind of version control for files, but your environment doesn't really support it. The script can be used for any types of files, but as copies are stored every time you archive the file you probably don't want to use it for very large files.

Only useful on Windows, as it is a Windows batch script.
